# FedEx Ground Economy / SmartPost for Zen Cart Mod

(Under development, for personal purposes only)

This module is based on the Numinix FedEx Smartpost Shipping Module, v1.3.1 with some modifications/updates to support newer Zen Cart version. Tested in ZC 1.5.7d with PHP 7.4

The following four numbers are needed to use this plug-in: 
FedEx Key, FedEx Password, FedEx Account Number, FedEx Meter Number

I copied the current FedEx Key and FedEx password from the latest fedexwebservices (also from Numinix). Then I put my Acct# and Meter# there, and it worked. Please also note, FedEx doesn't provide new product keys any more. This mod is only for old users. 

If unable to fix the warning, add "error_reporting(0);" to the top line.
